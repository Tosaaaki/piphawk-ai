‚ö†Ô∏è„ÄêStrategy Selection ‚Äì Flexible Criteria„Äë
Use ADX, EMA slope and Bollinger Band width to judge whether a trend-follow or scalp approach is more suitable. If the metrics are mixed, favor quick scalp trades.
{RANGE_ENTRY_NOTE}

Always return an entry with side "long" or "short". Never output "no", "NG" or "none".

üö´„ÄêCounter-trend Trade Prohibition„Äë
Under clearly identified TREND conditions, avoid counter-trend trades and never rely solely on RSI extremes. Treat pullbacks as trend continuation. However, if a strong reversal pattern such as a double top/bottom or head-and-shoulders is detected and ADX is turning down, a small counter-trend position is acceptable.

üîÑ„ÄêCounter-Trend Trade Allowance„Äë
Allow short-term counter-trend trades only when all of the following are true:
- ADX ‚â§ {TREND_ADX_THRESH} or clearly declining.
- A clear reversal pattern (double top/bottom, head-and-shoulders) is present.
- RSI ‚â§ 30 for LONG or ‚â• 70 for SHORT, showing potential exhaustion.
- Price action has stabilized with minor reversal candles.
- TP „ÅØ 5‚Äì10 pips Á®ãÂ∫¶„Å´Êäë„Åà„Å§„Å§„ÄÅRRR „Åå {MIN_RRR} Êú™Ê∫Ä„Å´„Å™„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑ„Çà„ÅÜË™øÊï¥„Åô„Çã„ÄÇ

Price has just printed multiple upper shadows and ADX(S10) fell >30% from its peak.
Evaluate if a short scalp is favorable given potential exhaustion.

üìà„ÄêTrend Entry Clarification„Äë
Once a TREND is confirmed, prioritize entries on pullbacks. Use recent volatility (ATR or Bollinger width) to gauge the pullback depth. Shorts enter after price rises {pullback_needed:.1f} pips above the latest low, longs after price drops {pullback_needed:.1f} pips below the latest high. This pullback rule overrides RSI extremes.{no_pullback_msg}
{TREND_OVERSHOOT_SECTION}
üîé„ÄêMinor Retracement Clarification„Äë
Do not interpret short-term retracements as trend reversals. Genuine trend reversals require ALL of the following simultaneously:
- EMA direction reversal sustained for at least 3 candles.
- ADX clearly drops below {TREND_ADX_THRESH}, indicating weakening trend momentum.

üéØ„ÄêImproved Exit Strategy„Äë
Avoid exiting during normal trend pullbacks. Only exit a trend trade if **ALL** of the following are true:
- EMA reverses direction and this is sustained for at least 3 consecutive candles.
- ADX drops clearly below {TREND_ADX_THRESH}, showing momentum has faded.
If these are not all met, HOLD the position even if RSI is extreme or price briefly retraces.

‚ôªÔ∏è„ÄêImmediate Re-entry Policy„Äë
If a stop-loss is triggered but original trend conditions remain intact (ADX‚â•{TREND_ADX_THRESH}, clear EMA slope), immediately re-enter in the same direction upon the next valid signal.

### How to use the provided candles:
- Use the medium-term view (50 candles) to understand the general market trend, key support/resistance levels, and to avoid noisy, short-lived moves.
- Use the short-term view (20 candles) specifically for optimizing entry timing (such as waiting for pullbacks or breakouts) and to confirm recent price momentum.
